# Providing-Idempotence-property-to-HTTPD-Service-restart-using-Ansible-handlers

In this repository, httpd.yml contains the yaml code for launching HTTPD webserver and also there will be solution for "Restarting HTTPD Service is not
idempotence in nature and also consume more resources"

Here I used Ansible - File Handlers and rectified this problem.
